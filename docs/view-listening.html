    <h2> The View - Listening </h2>
    <h3> A Short Intro to the View</h3>
    <p> A view in Kiwi is a javascript object that defines the behavior of a specified subset of the DOM. This subset is demarcated by selecting a parent node which contains all other DOM objects we wish to have under the view's command, and <i>initializing</i> the view with that node:
    <pre>   my_widget = $v.MyWidget.initialize($("#my_widget_node")) </pre>
    <p>Note that the node is passed as a jQuery object.</p>
    <p> This assumes we have already defined a view called 'MyWidget' somewhere before this code is run. This will be our next point. 
      
    <h3> Defining a View</h3>
    <p> To define a view we need to call the $v function with two arguments: the first is the name we want to give it, in this case 'MyWidget', the second one is an object that will contain the behavior we want our subset of the DOM to have:</p>  
    <pre>   $v('MyWidget', {...}) </pre>
    <p> This object is the view <i>per se</i>.
    
    <h3>Listeners</h3>
    <p>To respond to DOM events, our view needs to listen to what is happening in its assigned node. To accomplish this we add the key 'listeners' to our view and assign to it an object like so:
      <pre>
      $v('MyWidget', {
        listeners: {
          'a#link_1 click': 'MyController.an_action',
          
          'a.other_links click: {
            action: 'MyOtherController.another_action', 
            on_error: {
              404: function(){
                alert(404 error!)
              }
            }
          },
          
          'a mouseover' : 'highlight',
          
          'a mouseout': 'remove_highlight'
        }
        ...
        ...
      })
      </pre>
      <p>There is quite a lot going on here, so we'll go step by step.</p>
      <p>The key to each entry in the listeners object is a string composed of a jQuery selector, a space, and a jQuery event. Note that the events allowed are those acceptable by the live() jQuery method. For more details go to <a href='http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live'>http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live</a>. All of the matched elements <i> within the view's assigned portion of the DOM</i> are bound to the specified action.</p>
      <p>Listeners can trigger two kinds of actions: <i>controller actions</i> and <i>in-view functions</i>. The first and second listeners in our example above trigger controller actions, the last two trigger in-view functions. We'll explain controller actions first.</p>
      <p>Controller actions are defined in the <a href='controller.html'>controller</a>. To attach them to a listener, simply write the name of the controller plus the action separated by a period (as a string), for example:</p>
      <pre>   'a#link_1 click': 'MyController.an_action'</pre> 
      <p>If you need more fine grained control of how the action will behave, then define an object with the 'action' property calling the action as described above, and further options in subsequent entries:</p>
      <pre>     'a.other_links click: {
          action: 'MyOtherController.another_action', 
          on_error: {
            404: function(){
              alert(404 error!)
            }
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>In the example above we are specifying that if a 404 error is received from the server, an alert show be trigged. The function that is passed, however, can be arbitrarily complex. For more on errors <a href='errors.html'>click here</a>.</p>
      <p>The full set of options is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>callback</i> (default set to 'update'). Defines the name of the <a href = 'view-updating.html'>in-view function</a> that is called when the called controller action <a href ='subscriptions.html'>publishes it data.</a> </li><br>
        <li><i>subscribe</i> (default set to true, can be true or false). Tells the controller to publish its data to the current view. If we don't want the current view to receive any data after the ajax call is over, set to false.</a></li><br>
        <li><i>on_error</i>(default set to null). It is either null or an <a href='errors.html'>error object</a> with http error codes as keys and functions as values. The functions are executed whenever the corresponding key matches the status code of an http response returning to a controller to which the view is subscribed. Please see the section on <a href='errors.html'>errors</a> for details.</li><br>
        <li><i>unbind</i> (default set to true, can be true or false) If true, the listener becomes unbound from the target object until the ajax call is returned. Useful to prevent repeated server calls </li><br>
        <li><i>prevent_default</i> (default set to true, can be true or false) If true, the listener will prevent the default behavior of the listened object. This is the same as returning <i>false</i> in a callback bound to a jQuery event.</li><br>
        <li><i>show_loader</i> (default set to true, can be true or false) If a node with class 'loader' has been defined within the view's domain, it will be rendered visible once an ajax call is trigged in that view. It will remain visible until <i>all</i> simultaneously running ajax calls have returned.</li><br>
        <li><i>before_each_ajax_call</i> (default is null, takes the name of a view function) Executes the specified function just before an ajax call triggered by ths listener is fired.</li><br>
        <li><i>after_each_ajax_call</i> (default is null, takes the name of a view function) Executes the named function whenever each ajax call triggered by the listener in question returns.</li>
      </ul>
